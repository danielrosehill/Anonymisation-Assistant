## The Monster Behind The Mahogany Desk (Test Diary 001)

9:47 AM, Tuesday. Another soul-crushing day at Progressive Voices Foundation. Three years I've been here, and each day under Sarah Blackwood feels like walking through a minefield in the dark. I'm writing this from the third-floor break room, hands still shaking as I try to hold my now-cold coffee.

I was finishing up our quarterly donor communications report at my desk - station 3B in the open plan office, right under the aggressively cold air vent - when she stormed in at exactly 10:32 AM. Her trademark Louboutin heels (the red-soled ones she bought after our successful fundraising gala) clicking like warning signals on the hardwood floor. The report wasn't due until next Thursday at 3 PM, but she'd decided, without telling anyone, that she needed it by 5 PM today.

"This is completely unacceptable, Marcus," she hissed, waving my draft in front of my face, her silver bangles jangling. "How dare you use Arial font when our style guide clearly states Calibri? And 11-point font? Are you deliberately trying to sabotage our brand consistency?"

I tried explaining that I was still formatting the document, but she cut me off with that dismissive wave - the one where she flicks her right hand like she's shooing away an annoying insect. The entire office fell silent - that eerie quiet that happens when everyone is pretending to work while actually listening. Even Jim from Accounting stopped his perpetual pen-clicking.

"You know what your problem is?" she said, her voice rising to that pitch that makes the fluorescent lights seem even harsher. "You lack attention to detail. You're sloppy. Careless." She paused, letting each word land like a slap. "Maybe this role is just... beyond your capabilities."

Just yesterday, at 2 PM in the conference room with the broken blinds, she'd praised my work on the #VoicesForChange social media campaign during our team meeting. Today, at 10:32 AM, I'm apparently incompetent because of a font choice. The whiplash from her mood swings is exhausting.

During the 3:15 PM staff meeting in the Harmony Room (ironic name, really), she did it again. As I presented the engagement metrics for our latest advocacy campaign, she interrupted every other sentence with cutting remarks. "Did you even bother to cross-reference these numbers?" "This is basic stuff, Marcus. Basic." By the end, my hands were shaking so badly I could barely hold my color-coded presentation notes.

The worst part? When the meeting ended at 4:45 PM, she switched instantly to her public persona - all smiles and charm as she chatted with the program directors about their weekend plans, laughing about some new bistro on 7th Street. Sometimes I wonder if I'm going crazy, if I'm imagining the Jekyll and Hyde routine.

I used to love communications work. I believed in our mission of advocating for educational equity. Now? I spend 15 minutes every morning in my 2019 Civic, gathering courage to walk through those smudged glass doors. My inbox (currently at 347 unread messages) triggers anxiety attacks. Every Teams message makes my stomach clench, especially those marked with the red exclamation point she's so fond of using.

Tomorrow, she'll probably act like nothing happened. She might even bring me coffee from Blue Moon Caf√© - she does that sometimes, after her explosions. Always a large vanilla latte with an extra shot and light foam, as if her remembering my coffee order somehow makes up for the public humiliation, the constant criticism, the way she's eroded my confidence into dust.

I should look for another job. I know I should. But after months of hearing how incompetent I am, how could I convince another employer to hire me? Maybe she's right. Maybe I am just... inadequate.

It's now 5:23 PM. Most of the office has left, except for Lisa from HR who always stays late. I can hear the cleaning crew starting their rounds, the familiar squeak of their cart wheels. This is my first time writing this down. My hands are trembling even now, making typos that I frantically correct because I can hear her voice in my head criticizing every missed keystroke.

For now, I'll proofread this donor report for the sixth time, double-check every single font (Calibri, 11-point, with 1.15 line spacing), and pray that tomorrow is one of her "good" days.

## The Monster Behind The Mahogany Desk (Test Diary 001)

9:47 AM, Tuesday. Another soul-crushing day at New Horizon Institute. Three years I've been here, and each day under Rachel Patel feels like walking through a minefield in the dark. I'm writing this from the third-floor break room, hands still shaking as I try to hold my now-cold coffee.

I was finishing up our quarterly donor communications report at my desk - station 3B in the open plan office, right under the aggressively cold air vent - when she stormed in at exactly 10:32 AM. Her trademark loafers clicking like warning signals on the hardwood floor. The report wasn't due until next Thursday at 3 PM, but she'd decided, without telling anyone, that she needed it by 5 PM today.

"This is completely unacceptable, Julian," she hissed, waving my draft in front of my face, her wooden beads jangling. "How dare you use Arial font when our style guide clearly states Calibri? And 11-point font? Are you deliberately trying to sabotage our brand consistency?"

During the 3:15 PM staff meeting in the Unity Room, she did it again. As I presented the engagement metrics for our latest advocacy campaign, she interrupted every other sentence with cutting remarks. "Did you even bother to cross-reference these numbers?" "This is basic stuff, Julian. Basic." By the end, my hands were shaking so badly I could barely hold my color-coded presentation notes.

The worst part? When the meeting ended at 4:45 PM, she switched instantly to her public persona - all smiles and charm as she chatted with the program directors about their weekend plans, laughing about some new bistro on Main Street.
